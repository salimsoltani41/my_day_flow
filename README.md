## 📱 My Day Flow

My Day Flow is a mobile application built with **Flutter** that helps users build healthy routines, track their mood, and stay motivated throughout the day.  

This project was developed as part of the **IBM Android and iOS Mobile Development Capstone**, but goes beyond the requirements by incorporating professional Flutter practices and additional features. The app is also published on the Google Play Store, making it a real-world, production-ready project.

## 📐 Planning & Design Process

I approached this project using **Agile methodology** with clearly defined user stories and iterative development.

### 1. Design Mockups
I then moved to high-fidelity mockups in **Figma**, refining the visual style, colors, and typography.

### 3. Project Architecture Pattern
For scalability and maintainability, I applied a clean project architecture pattern with separation of concerns between UI, state management, and data layers.

## 🚀 Development Approach

While the capstone only required basic functionality, I intentionally went further to create a **portfolio-grade application**:

- Implemented **GetX** for clean and reactive state management  
- Added both **Hive** and **SharedPreferences** for robust data persistence  
- Integrated **external APIs** for motivational quotes  
- Documented the codebase with comments for maintainability  
- Ensured **dark mode support** and a polished UI experience

## 🏆 Reflection

This project not only fulfills the requirements of the **IBM Mobile Development Capstone**, but also demonstrates my ability as a **Flutter developer** to:  

- Plan, design, and implement a complete mobile app from scratch  
- Use **clean architecture** and professional coding practices  
- Integrate APIs, local databases, and notifications  
- Deploy an application to the Google Play Store  

I went beyond the expectations of the course to make this app **portfolio-ready** and to showcase my skills as a mobile developer.
